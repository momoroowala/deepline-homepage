    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you schedule a consultation through Calendly, we collect your name, email address, and any information you provide in the booking form. When you submit QuickBooks export data for analysis, we collect the transaction and customer data contained in that export.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your contact information to schedule and conduct consultations. Customer data exports are used solely to perform the revenue recovery diagnostic you requested. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information or business data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All client data is handled with strict confidentiality. QuickBooks exports are processed on secure systems and deleted after the diagnostic is delivered unless you engage us for ongoing services.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Contact information is retained for the duration of our business relationship. Diagnostic data from QuickBooks exports is deleted within 30 days of delivery unless an ongoing engagement is established.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may request deletion of your personal information or business data at any time by contacting us at mo@deeplineop.ai.</p>
